# SeRen Sample Project
A basic interactive scene showcasing SeRen's abilities.

This doubles as a testing grounds for SeRen's capabilities.

It is possible to specify the file that holds the game's base configuration
through the `--game-cfg-path`. It is, by default, `./game`, but should be `.`
here, as `cfg.yaml` is located in the root directory of this repository.

Namely: `serenn --game-cfg-path .`.
